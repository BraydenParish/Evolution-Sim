# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

- Scope: repository root and all subdirectories.
- Follow tests-first mindset; add or update tests before implementing fixes or features when feasible.
- Aim for minimal, focused diffs; avoid unrelated changes and keep existing style.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and justified.
- Ground documentation or API references with citations when applicable.
- Preserve existing invariants and public behaviors unless explicitly changing them.
- Default commands (if available): tests via `pytest`; no dedicated typecheck or lint configured.
