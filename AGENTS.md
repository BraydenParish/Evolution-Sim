# Agent Guidelines
- Follow a tests-first workflow: add/extend tests before implementing fixes or features.
- Keep diffs minimal and localized; avoid drive-by changes and new dependencies unless strictly required.
- Preserve existing behaviors and invariants noted in README (Dual-Brain system, non-blocking AI) and document any deviations.
- Cite external references for nontrivial APIs or framework usage in commit/PR descriptions.
